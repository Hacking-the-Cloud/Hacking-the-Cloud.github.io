[{"content":"Author: Nick Frichette\nOriginal Research: Ian Williams\nLink to Tool: GitHub\nWhen performing an AWS assessment you will likely encounter IAM Credentials. Traditionally, the majority of these that you would find would only be usable from the AWS CLI. Using a tool called AWS Consoler you can create links that will allow you to access the AWS Console. In this example we will walk through gathering credentials and using those credentials along with Consoler to generate a Console link.\nFirst, we need to gather valid IAM credentials. These are typically found a number of different ways. In this example, we have shell access to an EC2 instance with an attached role and we will curl the metadata service to access them.\nNext, install and compile AWS Consoler (install Python dependencies with pip and then do a sudo make install).\nFrom here invoke the Consoler tool and provide the -a (access key) -s (secret access key) and -t (session token) flags along with the retrieved values.\nThis will generate a link you can use to access the AWS Console.\n","description":"Leverage stolen credentials to use the AWS Console","id":0,"section":"aws","tags":null,"title":"AWS Consoler","uri":"https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/persistence/aws_consoler/"},{"content":"When performing offensive security operations you have a multitude of options for the type of assessment you\u0026rsquo;d like to conduct.
