This allows the security groups to track information about the network traffic and allow/deny that traffic based on the Security Group rules.
There are two kinds of traffic flows; tracked and untracked. For example the AWS documentation mentions a tracked flow as the following, &amp;ldquo;if you initiate an ICMP ping command to your instance from your home computer, and your inbound security group rules allow ICMP traffic, information about the connection (including the port information) is tracked.</description></item><item><title>IAM ID Identifiers</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/iam-key-identifiers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/iam-key-identifiers/</guid><description>Last updated: 12/20/2020

This contains (surprise) metadata about that specific EC2 instance.
How to Access the Metadata Service The metadata service can be accessed at http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ from the EC2 instance.
IMDSv2 Version two of the metadata service has added protections against SSRF and requires the user to create and use a token. You can access it via the following.
user@host:~$ TOKEN=`curl -X PUT &amp;quot;http://169.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to User Data</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/introduction_user_data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/introduction_user_data/</guid><description>Instance user data is used to run commands when an EC2 instance is started or rebooted. This can be an excellent source of information for us as attackers. It typically takes the form of a shell script that can be accessed from the EC2 instance.
How to Access the User Data User data can be accessed at http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/ from the EC2 instance.
